                                I have experience in fullstack development, but my main expertise is the frontend world. I love developing beautiful websites and mobile apps and creating platforms
                                with great design.
                            </p>

                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Technology is my passion! I&apos;m always learning new things to add to my skill set, especially modern ones, so that I can help by adding value to projects and
                                delivering a high quality product.
                            </p>

                        <div>
                            <p>
                                And last but not least, I have ease for business analysis due to the degree I&apos;m currently studying, so I can collaborate with solutions for many areas of an
                                organization.
